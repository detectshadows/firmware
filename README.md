# shadow detect firmware OTA updates

two files: 

version.txt (contains the current version number)
firmware.bin (contains the compiled firmware for the version)

scans currently implemented:

subnet size calcualtor - takes the gateway ip and subnet mask, calculates beginning and end ip addresses of network
arp_scan - sends out an arp query for every ip address in the network, gathers mac addresses (used in all other scans from then on)
mdns_broadcast - listens for mdns broadcast packets, extrracts PTR and TXT information, periodically uploads to cloud
ssdp_broadcast - listens for ssdp broadcast packets, periodically uploads to cloud
ssdp_scan - probes for ssdp services
ssdp_tv_scan - probes for ssdp dial services
ssdp_location - on finding location info on ssdp or ssdp_tv scans, fetches the location info and parses
MDNs / Bonjour services scan - searches the network for specific bonjour / mdns services
NBNS scan - queries and collects the NetBios machine names from the network
iphone_scan - checks all devices returned by arp_scan for open port 62078
port_scan - checks all devices returned by arp_scan for open port 9, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 67, 68, 80, 88, 110, 135, 137, 138, 139, 143, 153, 161, 162, 220, 443, 445, 587, 8080, 993, 995, 1080, 1194, 1900, 3306, 62078
